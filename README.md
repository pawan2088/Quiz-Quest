## 🔧 How It Works

1. **User selects a category** from the main section.
2. A popup appears asking for:
   - Difficulty level (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`)
   - Number of questions (between 1 and 20)
3. On submission:
   - Choices are stored using `sessionStorage`
   - User is navigated to the next page (e.g., `page2.html`)
4. Ready to take the quiz!
